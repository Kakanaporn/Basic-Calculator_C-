PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY 1.6
 * Supanat Kakanaporn
 * ID: 445682
 * Using the previous activities create a three (3) new math libraries with the following methods
    Arithmetic
         Addition
         Subtraction
         Division
         Multiplication
    Trigonometric
         Tan
         Sine
         Cosine
    Algebraic
         Square Root
         Cube Root
         Inverse
 * Criteria
    Each of these methods will require some research to ensure the correct values are displayed. 
    For example the Tan(90o) is undefined and your calculator should display an “invalid” message. 
    Check the MSDN web site for information and sample code for each trigonometric function to ensure correct functionality.
    Testing
    Create a test table for each method with a range of valid and invalid data. 
    Record your results in a table with screen shots in a formal report.
